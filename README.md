# YouTube Shorts Remover

A Chrome extension to remove the "Shorts" link from YouTube's sidebar, as well as not allowing navigation to any /shorts/ URLs.

## Why?

Because I don't want to see YouTube Shorts. I don't want to see them in my sidebar, I don't want to see them in my search results, and I don't want to see them in my recommended videos. I don't want to see them anywhere. I don't want to see them, Shadoath I Am.

They waste my time and I don't find them entertaining. I don't want to see them. I don't want to see them, Shadoath I Am.

## Installation
